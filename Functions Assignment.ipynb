They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function when it's called.\n","\n","- Example\n","- def project(projectname,team): # projectname and team are parameters\n","      print(f\"{projectname}, {team}\")\n","\n","-Arguments - Arguments are the actual values that are passed to a function when it's called. They are the concrete data that the function will use.\n","\n","-Example\n","- project(\"McD\", \"DevTeam\") # \"McD\" and \"DevTeam\" are arguments\n","\n","3.What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","\n","- Funtion Defination\n","- It uses the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for parameters, and a colon.\n","The function body is indented.\n","-it uses return keyword to return value\n","Python\n","\n","def greet(name):\n","\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","\n","\n","greet(\"Suvarna\")\n","\n","-following are differnt way to call a function\n","- 1) Default Arguments\n","- You can provide default values for function parameters. If an argument isn't passed when calling the function, the default value is used.\n","- function to find the product of 3 or less numbers\n","- def prod(a=1, b=1, c=1):\n","- return a* b* c\n","- prod(2,3)\n","- output\n","6\n","\n","- 2)Variable length args:\n","\n","- Variable-length arguments allow a function to accept a varying number of arguments. There are two types\n","of variable-length arguments: *args and **kwargs.\n","- Example\n","- a. *args (Arbitrary Arguments)A\n","E It allows a function to accept any number of positional argumentsK\n","E The asterisk (*) before the parameter name is used to denote that it can take multiple argumentsK\n","E The arguments passed with *args are treated as a tuple.\n","Example1\n","\n","- print the args whatever length it may be\n","def a(*args):\n","for i in args:\n","print(i)\n","a(2,3,5,6,8) #calling function\n","\n"," - output\n","2\n","3\n","5\n","6\n","8\n","\n","- b. **kwargs (Keyword Arguments)\n","- It allows a function to accept any number of keyword arguments'\n","- The arguments passed with **kwargs are treated as a dictionary.\n","- Example\n","- def my_function(**kwargs):\n","-- for key, value in kwargs.items():\n","--  - print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n","my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3)\n","- Output: a: 1\n","- b: 2\n","- c: 3\n","\n","- 3 positional argument\n","- passing a variable inside funtion is called positional argument\n","- def greetings(name):\n","-     print(f\"welcome to team {name}\")\n","-greetings(\"suvarna\")\n","-output - welcome to team suvarna\n","\n","4.What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n","- When a return statement is encountered, the function's execution immediately terminates, and control is passed back to the caller.\n","- Example\n","- def add(x, y):\n","- -   result = x + y\n","- -  return result\n","\n","- sum_of_numbers = add(5, 3)\n","- print(sum_of_numbers) # Output: 8\n","- The add function takes two arguments, x and y.\n","- It calculates their sum and stores it in the result variable.\n","- The return result statement sends the calculated sum back to the caller.\n","- The caller then assigns that returned value to the sum_of_numbers variable.\n","\n","5.What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","- Iterables:\n","- An iterable is an object that can be looped over.1 It's capable of returning its members one at a time\n","- Iterables have an __iter__() method.\n","- Iterators maintain state, keeping track of their position in the sequence\n","\n","- Iterators:\n","- An iterator is an object that enables you to traverse through an iterable.\n","- Iterators have a __next__() method.\n","\n","- Iterables themselves do not keep track of state.\n","\n","6.Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined?\n","- Generators in Python are a special type of iterator that allow you to create iterators in a more concise and memory-efficient way. They are defined using functions with the yield keyword, rather than return.\n","\n","- Generators are defined using functions that contain the yield keyword.\n","- def count_up_to(n):\n"," - i = 1\n"," - while i <= n:\n","   - yield i\n","    - i += 1\n","\n","- Using the generator\n","- for number in count_up_to(5):\n","  - print(number)\n","\n","- Output:\n","- 1\n","- 2\n","-  3\n","-  4\n","- 5\n","\n","7.What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","- Regular Functions: Typically compute and store the entire result in memory before returning it. This can be problematic for large datasets, as it can lead to memory exhaustion.\n","- Generators: Produce values on demand, yielding one item at a time. They don't store the entire sequence in memory, making them ideal for processing large amounts of data without consuming excessive resources\n","\n","8.What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","- A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword.\n","- use case\n","- It's designed for simple, one-line functions that you might need for a short period.\n","- When you need a quick function for a specific task without the overhead of defining a regular function\n","\n","9.Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python\n","- The map() function in Python is a built-in function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) and returns an iterator that yields the results.\n","\n","- Purpose:\n","\n","- The primary purpose of map() is to avoid explicit loops when you need to transform each element of an iterable. It provides a more concise and often more efficient way to perform element-wise operations.\n","\n","10.What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","- map():\n","Transforms each element.\n","One-to-one mapping.\n","Returns an iterator of the same length (or shorter, if multiple iterables are used).\n","- filter():\n","Selects elements based on a condition.\n","Can change the length of the iterable.\n","Returns an iterator of filtered elements.\n","- reduce():\n","Aggregates elements into a single value.\n","Reduces the iterable to a single result.\n","Returns a single value.\n","\n","11.Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given\n","list:[47,11,42,13]\n","- note i was not able
